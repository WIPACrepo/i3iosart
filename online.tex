\section{\label{online}Online Systems}
\textsl{(John K; 12-15 pages)}

The IceCube online systems comprise both the software and hardware 
at the detector site responsible for data acquisition, event selection,
monitoring, and data storage and movement.  As one of the goals of IceCube
operations is to maximize the fraction of time the detector is sensitive
to neutrino interactions (``uptime''), the online systems are modular so
that failures in one 
particular component do not necessarily prevent the continuation of basic
data acquisition. Additionally, all systems are monitored with a combination of
custom-designed and industry-standard tools so that detector operators can
be alerted in case of abnormal conditions.

\subsection{\label{online:dataflow}Data Flow Overview}

The online data flow consists of a number of steps of data reduction and
selection in the progression from photon detection in the glacial ice to
candidate neutrino event selection, along with associated secondary data
streams and monitoring.  An overview of the data flow is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dataflow}.  

Since the majority of photons detected by the DOMs are dark noise, a
first-level \emph{local coincidence} (LC) is formed between neighboring
DOMs deployed along the same cable, using dedicated wire pairs within the
in-ice cable.  DOM-level triggers, or \emph{hits}, with corresponding
neighbor hits are flagged with the LC condition, while hits without the
condition are compressed more aggressively.  The LC time window as well as
the span of neighbor DOMs up and down the cable can both be configured,
with standard settings of a $\pm1 \mu s$ coincidence window and neighbor
span of 2 DOMs. 

All DOM hits are read out to dedicated computers on the surface by the data
acquisition system (DAQ).  The next level of data selection is the
formation of \emph{triggers} by the DAQ system.  LC-flagged hits across the
detector are examined for temporal and in some cases spatial patterns that
suggest a common causal relationship.  A number of different trigger
algorithms run in parallel, described in Sect.~\ref{sect:trigger}.  All hits
(both LC-flagged and non-LC hits) within a window around the trigger are
combined into \emph{events}, the fundamental output of the DAQ, and written
to disk.  The event rate is approximately 2.5 kHz but varies with the
seasonal atmopheric muon flux, and the total DAQ data rate is approximately
1TB/day.   

The DAQ also produces \emph{secondary streams} that include time
calibration, monitoring, and DOM scaler data.  The scaler data, which is
monitoring the noise rate of each DOM in 1.6 ms bins, is used in the
supernova data acquisition system \cite{sndaq} to detect a global rise from
many $O(10)$ MeV neutrino interactions occuring in the ice from a
Galactic core-collapse supernova.  The time calibration and monitoring
streams are used to monitor the health and quality of the data-taking runs.

The raw DAQ event data is then processed further with a number of
\emph{filters} in order to select a subset of events (less than 10\%) to
transfer over satellite to the Northern Hemisphere (see
Sect.~\ref{sect:filter}).  Each 
filter, typically designed to select events useful for a particular physics
analysis, is run 
over all events using a computing cluster in the IceCube Lab.  Because of
limitations both on total computing power and bounds on the processing time
of each event, only fast directional and energy reconstructions are used.
The processing and filtering system is also responsible for applying
up-to-date calibrations to the DAQ data; processed events, even those not
selected by the online filters, are stored locally for archival.

A dedicated system for data movement handles the local archival storage to
tape or disk, as well as the handoff of satellite data (see Sect.~\ref{sec:jade}).
This includes not only primary data streams but also monitoring data,
calibration runs, and other data streams.

\subsection{Data Handling}
\textsl{(P. Meade; 1 page)}

\textsl{Generation description of system architecture.  Stream definitions, dropboxes,
and data pickup.  Archival vs. transfer to TDRSS system.  }

Data handling is provided by three servers named jade02, jade03, and jade04. The jade servers operate independently of one another and 
each of them are capable of handling the nominal data volume by itself. Having three servers allows for data handling to continue seamlessly 
in case of hardware failure or maintenance.

Each server runs a copy of the Java Archival and Data Exchange (JADE) software (stylized “jade”). As its name implies, the jade software 
is written in the Java programming language. It is a reimplementation and expansion of earlier prototype software called South Pole Archival
and Data Exchange (SPADE), written by Cindy Mackenzie. The jade software has four primary tasks: consumption, archival, satellite transmission, and real-time
transmission.

The jade software is configured with a number of data streams, which consist of a data server, a dropbox directory, and a filename pattern. 
The data stream dropbox directories are checked on a regular basis for new files. A file pairing scheme (binary and semaphore) prevents files 
from being consumed before they are finished being produced. For each file, a checksum calculated on the data server is compared to a checksum 
calculated on the jade server. This method ensures that the file was copied without error. After this, the original data file is removed from the data host.

After consumption, files are routed according to the configuration of their data stream. Files that are too large to send via the satellite link are archived to
a configurable number of archival media copies. The prototype SPADE software archived to LTO tapes, while the later jade software archives to large (2+ TB) hard
disk drives. All of the archival data is buffered on the jade server until the archival media is complete. In case of failure while creating the archival media, 
all of the files can be immediately written to fresh archival media with a single command.

Files that are too large to send via the real-time link, but small enough to send via the satellite link are queued for satellite transmission. The jade software
attempts to bundle multiple files together into 1 GB bundle archives to allow satellite link operators to manage the daily data transmission. Very large files
(>1 GB) are split apart into multiple 1 GB bundles for the same reason. The jade software will only transfer a configurable number of bundles to the satellite
relay server. If satellite transmission is not possible, the jade software will buffer the excess bundles on the jade server, to avoid flooding the relay server
unnecessarily.


Small files (<50 KB) with high priority status information are sent via the real-time link. The real-time link is provided by the IceCube Messaging Service
(I3MS). The jade software uses JeroMQ, a pure Java implementation of the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) protocol, to connect to I3MS. In cases where the real-time link is not
available, I3MS will queue the messages to be sent when the link becomes available. All I3MS messages are also sent to jade to send via the satellite link to
ensure delivery if the real-time link should be unavailable for an extended period of time.
