  Abstract                 = {The IceCube neutrino telescope is an array of Optical Modules (DOM) deployed in a volume of 1 cubic km. The DOMs record the Cherenkov light produced by secondary particles emerging from neutrino interactions with the ice. Based on the patern of the observed light, we can differentiate between lepton flavors and thus determine the primary neutrino flavor. Astrophysical models only predict production of muon and electron neutrinos in significant amounts. However, after traveling cosmological distances we expect on Earth the same flux for all three neutrino flavors due to neutrino oscillations. Because the tau neutrino production in the atmosphere is also negligible, this channel is nearly free of atmospheric background. In this report, I summarize how we can identify tau neutrinos through the detection of a tau decaying into a muon and explain the strategy developped to distinguish a tau from a muon track.},

  Abstract                 = {Data from the IceCube detector in its 22-string configuration (IC22) were used to directly measure the atmospheric muon energy spectrum near the horizon. After passage through more than 10 km of ice, muon bundles from air showers are reduced to single muons, whose energy can be estimated from the total number of photons registered in the detector. The energy distribution obtained in this way is sensitive to the cosmic ray composition around the knee and is complementary to measurements by air shower arrays. The method described extends the physics potential of neutrino telescopes and can easily be applied in similar detectors. Presented is the result from the analysis of one month of IC22 data.},

  Abstract                 = {The first string of 70 in the IceCube neutrino observatory was deployed at the South Pole site in January 2005 and is now taking data. An IceCube string is composed of 60 digital optical modules (DOMs) each of which is an integrated package of a large area photomultiplier tube, high voltage unit, LED flasher calibration board, and embedded digital data acquisition system encased inside a glass pressure housing. The DOM posed a challenging design problem that had to simultaneously meet the extremes of high reliability in a remotely-deployed high pressure and low temperature environment, low power, wide dynamic range from single photon hits emitted by passing cosmic ray muons to tens of thousands of photons from immense electromagnetic showers, and fast time tagging of events to nanosecond precision. In addition the DOM had to be cost effective and reliably producible in quantities of several thousand units. The first year of real DOM production and testing was 2004: 400 DOMs were produced worldwide and tested in special dark freezer laboratories at temperatures ranging from +25 to -55. Two hundred and eighty DOMs were sent to the South Pole for deployment and tested there again prior to deployment. Now frozen in the ice, the DOMs are showing exceptionally promising functionality},

  Abstract                 = {The low SMTn rate (n<8) in DeepCore shows a discrepancy between real data and MC simulation. We calculate the SMT3 and SMT4 rate analytically based on the assumption that accidental hits, generated by Poissonian noise, contribute to the increase in real data. Depending on the pure noise rate assumed per DOM (650Hz and 700HZ in DeepCore) we derive an accidental HLC rate of 1.12Hz to 1.39Hz for the SMT3 case and 2.30Hz to 2.78Hz regarding SMT4. Furthermore, a simulation of pure noise accidental hits was implemented and yields values of 1.60Hz for SMT3 and 0.70Hz for SMT4, respectively. Additionally, these results are compared with calcualtions by other authors.},

Da der Mechanismus der Explosion nicht ausreichend verstanden ist, w?re die Messung eines Ausbruchs von Neutrinos aus einem solchen Ereignis ein wichtiger Test, sowohl f?r die Explosionsmodelle als auch f?r die Elementarteilchenphysik. Das sich am Geographischen S?dpol befindende Neutrinoteleskop IceCube weist Tscherenkow-Photonen im antarktischen Gletscher nach. Obwohl es f?r die Detektion hochenergetischer Neutrinos konzipiert wurde, ist es wegen des niedrigen Sensorrauschens im Eis m?glich, den Neutrinoausbruch einer Supernova in der Milchstra?e ?ber eine kollektive Ratenerh?hung nachzuweisen. Mit einem speziell f?r Wasser-Tscherenkow-Teleskope entwickelten Signal-Monte-Carlo wird untersucht, inwiefern IceCube in der Lage ist, zwischen verschiedenen Supernovamodellen und Oszillationsszenarien zu unterscheiden. In einem zweiten Teil werden die mit dem IceCube-Vorl?ufer AMANDA aufgezeichneten neun Jahre an Informationen analysiert. Nach intensiver Datenbereinigung und Entwicklung einer Untergrundsimulation wird eine obere Grenze auf die erwartete Anzahl an Supernovae in der Milchstra?e gesetzt.},

  Abstract                 = {Since 1997 the neutrino telescope AMANDA at the geographic South Pole has been monitoring our Galaxy for neutrino bursts from supernovae. Triggers were introduced in 2004 to submit burst candidates to the Supernova Early Warning System SNEWS. From 2007 the burst search was extended to the much larger IceCube telescope, which now supersedes AMANDA. By exploiting the low photomultiplier noise in the antarctic ice (on average 280 Hz for IceCube), neutrino bursts from nearby supernovae can be identi?ed by the induced collective rise in the pulse rates. Although only a counting experiment, IceCube will provide the world?s most precise measurement of the time pro?le of a neutrino burst near the galactic center. The sensitivity to neutrino properties such as the theta_13 mixing angle and the neutrino hierarchy are discussed as well as the possibility to detect the deleptonization burst.

  Abstract                 = {The IceCube neutrino detector, located in the clear glacial ice at the South Pole, completed construction in 2011. The low-energy inll extension, DeepCore, forms a denser sub-detector using higher quantum effciency photosensors. DeepCore has been taking data since May 2010 and lowers IceCube's energy threshold to about 10 GeV. These low-energy events are dim compared to higher energy events, necessitating the study of low-light backgrounds. While Monte Carlo predictions give an expected rate of approximately 6 Hz due to atmospheric muons, DeepCore records a signicantly higher rate of 13.5 Hz with most of the discrepancy due to unsimulated noise events. Much of the rate dierence may be resolved by rejecting especially dim events by counting the number of locally coincident hits, retaining 55% of the nu_e and 62% of nu_mu events sampled with energies of 10-300 GeV while rejecting 96% of noise events. However, differences in the timing distributions of noise hits indicates a need for further study. A new source of correlated noise has been discovered, necessitating an updated noise simulation model. IceCube's new noise generator is able to reproduce the correlated noise in both IceCube and DeepCore sensors. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has been used to identify relevant parameters for nearly all of the 5160 sensors that make up the IceCube detector. Initial low qualityts reduce the rate discrepancy between data and simulation from 32% using a Poissonian noise model to 20% using the updated noise model with additional reduction possible . Noise which triggers the DeepCore detector is evaluated and rejected using the NoiseEngineltering module. Minimal cleaning removes 94% of noise triggers while retaining 85% of nu_e an 87% of nu_mu events with energies of 10-300 GeV. Stringent cleaning removes 99.9% of noise triggers while retaining only 55% of nu_e and 60% of nu_mu signal events in the same energy range.},

  Abstract                 = {Signalsamplig-hardwareTotzeit : p. 54 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IceCube, ein Neutrinoteleskop, welches zur Zeit am S?dpol aufgebaut und voraussichtlich 2011 fertiggestellt sein wird, kann galaktische Kernkollaps-Supernovae mit hoher Signifikanz und un?bertroffener statistischer Genauigkeit der Neutrinolichtkurve detektieren. Derartige Supernovae werden begleitet von einem massiven Ausbruch niederenergetischer Neutrinos aller Flavour. Beim Durchfliegen des Detektormediums Eis entstehen Positronen und Elektronen, welche wiederum lokale Tscherenkowlichtschauer produzieren, die in ihrer Summe das gesamte Eis erleuchten. Ein Nachweis ist somit, trotz der Optimierung IceCubes auf hochenergetische Teilchenspuren, ?ber eine kollektive Rauschratenerh?hung aller optischen Module m?glich. Die vorwiegende Reaktion ist der inverse Betazerfall der Antielektronneutrinos, welcher ?ber 90% des gesamten Signals ausmacht. Diese Arbeit beschreibt die Implementierung und Funktionsweise der Supernova-Datennahme-Software sowie der Echtzeitanalyse, mit welcher die oben genannte Nachweismethode seit August 2007 realisiert ist. Die Messdaten der ersten zwei Jahre wurden ausgewertet und belegen ein extrem stabiles Verhalten des Detektors insgesamt sowie fast aller Lichtsensoren, die eine gemittelte Ausfallquote von lediglich 0,3% aufweisen. Eine Simulation der Detektorantwort nach zwei unterschiedlichen Supernova-Modellen ergibt eine Sichtweite IceCubes, die im besten Falle bis zur 51 kpc entfernten Gro?en Magellanschen Wolke reicht. Leider ist der Detektor nicht in der Lage, die Deleptonisierungsspitze aufzul?sen, denn Oszillationen der Neutrinoflavour innerhalb des Sterns modifizieren die Neutrinospektren ung?nstig. Jedoch k?nnen modellunabh?ngig anhand des fr?hesten Signalanstiegs die inverse Massenhierarchie sowie etabliert werden, falls die Entfernung zur Supernova 6 kpc betr?gt. Gleiches kann durch Auswertung eines m?glichen Einflusses der Erdmaterie auf die Neutrinooszillation mit Hilfe der Messung eines zweiten Neutrinodetektors erreicht werden.},

The large flux of anti_nu_e from a Galactic supernova gives rise to Cherenkov light from positrons and electrons created in neutrino interactions which increase the overall count rate of the photomultipliers significantly. We will give an overview of the standard, count rate based, method for supernova detection and present the development of a novel technique. This technique uses coincident hits to extract additional information such as the average energy and spectral features. The potential of this technique increases with a higher sensor density, such as foreseen in projected extensions of IceCube/DeepCore.},

  Abstract                 = {The IceCube DeepCore [1] has been designed to lower the energy threshold and broaden the physics capabilities of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. A crucial part of the new opportunities provided by DeepCore is offered by the possibility to reject the background of atmospheric muons. This can be done by using the large instrumented volume of the standard IceCube configuration around Deep- Core as an active veto region. By thus restricting the expected signal to those neutrino events with an interaction vertex inside the central DeepCore region, it is possible to look for neutrinos from all directions, including the Southern Hemisphere that was previ- ously not accessible to IceCube. A reduction of the atmospheric muon background below the expected rate of neutrinos is provided by first vetoing events in DeepCore with causally related hits in the veto region. In a second step the potential starting vertex of a muon track is reconstructed and its credibility is estimated using a likelihood method. Events with vertex positions outside of DeepCore or with low starting probabilities are rejected. We present here these newly developed veto and vertex reconstruction techniques and present in detail their capabilities in background rejection and signal efficiency that have been obtained so far from full Monte Carlo studies},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate measurement of neutrino energies is essential to many of the scientific goals of large-volume neutrino telescopes. The fundamental observable in such detectors is the Cherenkov light produced by the transit through a medium of charged particles created in neutrino interactions. The amount of light emitted is proportional to the deposited energy, which is approximately equal to the neutrino energy for nu_e and nu_mu charged-current interactions and can be used to set a lower bound on neutrino energies and to measure neutrino spectra statistically in other channels. Here we describe methods and performance of reconstructing charged-particle energies and topologies from the observed Cherenkov light yield, including techniques to measure the energies of uncontained muon tracks, achieving average uncertainties in electromagnetic-equivalent deposited energy of ~15% above 10 TeV.},

  Abstract                 = {The IceCube Neutrino Observatory and its prototype, AMANDA, were built in South Pole ice, using powerful hot-water drills to cleanly bore {\textrangle}100 holes to depths up to 2500 m. The construction of these particle physics detectors provided a unique opportunity to examine the deep ice sheet using a variety of novel techniques. We made high-resolution particulate profiles with a laser dust logger in eight of the boreholes during detector commissioning between 2004 and 2010. The South Pole laser logs are among the most clearly resolved measurements of Antarctic dust strata during the last glacial period and can be used to reconstruct paleoclimate records in exceptional detail. Here we use manual and algorithmic matching to synthesize our South Pole measurements with ice-core and logging data from Dome C, East Antarctica. We derive impurity concentration, precision chronology, annual-layer thickness, local spatial variability, and identify several widespread volcanic ash depositions useful for dating. We also examine the interval around similar to 74 ka recently isolated with radiometric dating to bracket the Toba (Sumatra) supereruption.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the results of a search for high-energy muon neutrinos with the IceCube detector in coincidence with the Crab Nebula flare reported on 2010 September by various experiments. Due to the unusual flaring state of the otherwise steady source we performed a prompt analysis of the 79-string configuration data to search for neutrinos that might be emitted along with the observed ?-rays. We performed two different and complementary data selections of neutrino events in the time window of 10?days around the flare. One event selection is optimized for discovery of E ?2 ? neutrino spectrum typical of first-order Fermi acceleration. A similar event selection has also been applied to the 40-string data to derive the time-integrated limits to the neutrino emission from the Crab. The other event selection was optimized for discovery of neutrino spectra with softer spectral index and?TeV energy cutoffs as observed for various Galactic sources in ?-rays. The 90% confidence level (CL) best upper limits on the Crab flux during the 10?day flare are 4.73 ? 10 ?11?cm ?2?s ?1?TeV ?1 for an E ?2 ? neutrino spectrum and 2.50 ? 10 ?10?cm ?2?s ?1?TeV ?1 for a softer neutrino spectra of E ?2.7 ? , as indicated by Fermi measurements during the flare. In this paper, we also illustrate the impact of the time-integrated limit on the Crab neutrino steady emission. The limit obtained using 375.5?days of the 40-string configuration is compared to existing models of neutrino production from the Crab and its impact on astrophysical parameters is discussed. The most optimistic predictions of some models are already rejected by the IceCube neutrino telescope with more than 90% CL.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the response of the IceCube neutrino telescope located at the geographic south pole to outbursts of MeV neutrinos from the core collapse of nearby massive stars. IceCube was completed in December 2010 forming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ?1 km3 in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. The telescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV. Owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are particularly low. Hence IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos by observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark noise.With 2 ms timing resolution, IceCube can detect subtle features in the temporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the galactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free megaton-scale supernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20 standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at the Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). IceCube is sending triggers from potential supernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System. The sensitivity to neutrino properties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as the possibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of ?e?s released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse. Tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole as well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrate IceCube?s capability for supernova detection.},

  Abstract                 = {Neutrinooszillationen sind ein sehr aktives Forschungsfeld. In den letzten Jahrzehnten haben viele Experimente das Phaenomen untersucht und sind inzwischen zu Praezisionsmessungen vorangeschritten. Mit seiner Niederenergieerweiterung DeepCore kann das IceCube-Experiment zu diesem Forschungsfeld beitragen. IceCube ist ein 1 km^3 grosses Tscherenkow-Neutrino-Teleskop, welches das tiefe, antarktische Eis des Suedpols als optisches Medium nutzt. DeepCore ist eine Erweiterung mit dichterer Instrumentierung im unteren Teil des IceCube-Teleskops. Diese dichte Instrumentierung ermoeglicht den Nachweis von Neutrinos mit Energien ab einer Energieschwelle von etwa 10 GeV. Jedes Jahr werden Tausende von atmosphaerischen Neutrinos oberhalb dieser Schwelle in DeepCore detektiert. Eine Bestimmung der Energie der Neutrinos und des durch sie zurueckgelegten Weges durch die Erde ermoeglicht die Messung von Neutrinooszillationen. In dieser Arbeit werden zunachst die Moeglichkeiten von DeepCore diskutiert, Oszillationen auf unterschiedliche Weise zu messen. Das Verschwinden von Myon-Neutrinos wird als erfolgsversprechender Prozess ausgewaehlt. Darauf folgt die Beschreibung einer Methode zur Identifizierung von Tscherenkow-Photonen, welche detektiert wurden, bevor sie gestreut wurden -sogenannte- direkte Photonen. Mit Hilfe dieser Photonen kann der Zenitwinkel der Myon-Neutrinos bestimmmt werden. Auch die Energie der Neutrinos wird rekonstruiert. In den Jahren 2011 und 2012 wurden innerhalb von 343 Tagen mit dieser Analyse 1487 Neutrinokandidaten mit Energien zwischen 7 GeV und 100 GeV in DeepCore gefunden. Vergleicht man diese Zahl mit der erwarteten Zahl vom atmosphaerischen Neutrinofluss ohne Oszillationen, so ergibt sich ein Defizit von etwa 500 Ereignissen. Die Osziallationsparameter, die die Daten am besten beschreiben, sind im Einklang mit den Parametern, die von anderen Experimenten veroeffentlicht wurden.},
