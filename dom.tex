\section{\label{sec:dom}The Digital Optical Module}

\subsection{\label{sec:dom_functional} A Functional Description of the DOM}

The DOM is the fundamental light sensor and data acquisition unit for IceCube.
It consists of a spherical glass housing 
containing a downward-facing \SI{10}{''} diameter photomultiplier tube (PMT)
and associated circuit boards that allow near-autonomous operation (Figure~\ref{fig:domcomponents}).
Data acquisition, control, calibration, communication, and low voltage power conversion 
are integrated in one annular circuit board (Main Board) that fits around the neck of the PMT~\cite{ref:domdaq}. 
Separate circuit boards generate PMT high voltage, interface to the PMT pins~\cite{ref:pmt},
delay PMT signals, and generate calibration light flashes that can reach other DOMs.
Key requirements for the DOM include
the precise recording of a wide variety of PMT pulse widths and amplitudes, robustness in
a challenging deployment environment, and long-term reliability.

\end{figure}
%============================================================


The PMT detects signals from neutrino events ranging over energies
\unit[10]GeV--\unit[10]PeV and distances from a few meters to \unit[500]m
away.  Corresponding PMT waveforms can have amplitudes from \unit[1]mV up
to and beyond the linearity limit of the PMT (\unit[$\sim2$]V) and widths
from \unit[12]ns to \unit[1500]ns.  In order to accommodate such a variety
of signals, the DOM includes multiple digitizers with overlapping dynamic
range and different sampling speeds
(Sec.~\ref{sec:mainboard}).  Each DOM is triggered
independently by detection of individual photons, starting a recording of
the PMT waveform that also includes photons arriving up to
\unit[6.4]{$\mu$s} later.  The trigger time is saved along with the
waveform shape, allowing the determination of the times of arriving photons
relative to this reference.  The DOM typically accumulates such triggered
data for a period of \unit[1]s before sending as a block, although the DOM
can store $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\second})$ of data before overflowing local memory,
depending on trigger rate.  Separately, the PMT trigger rate is recorded by
the DOM in \unit[1.6]ms intervals, as a collective increase of all rates
could signify detection of many low energy neutrinos in case of a Galactic
supernova event (see Sec.~\ref{sect:online:supernova}).

DOMs transmit their data to computers in the IceCube Laboratory building (ICL)
using a twisted wire pair that also provides power (Sec.~\ref{sec:cable}).
Wire pairs are bundled to form the vertical in-ice cables and the horizontal surface
cables.  Each wire pair is shared between two DOMs, with data transfers
initiated by a surface computer.  Separately, dedicated wiring to neighbor
DOMs above and below allows quick recognition of local coincidences where
nearest or next-to-nearest neighbors trigger within a common \unit[1]$\mu$s
time window.  Local coincidence triggers often have complex PMT waveforms
indicating multiple photons detected in each DOM, which are therefore saved
in full detail; otherwise, the DOM saves abbreviated information appropriate
to single photon detection (Sec.~\ref{sec:mainboard}).

The DOM is capable of interpreting commands from the surface that specify
tasks for configuration, data taking and transmission, monitoring or
self-calibration.  Self-calibration functions establish PMT and amplifier
gains as well as sampling speed (Sec.~\ref{sec:domcal}).  The RAPCal
system (Sec.~\ref{sect:dom:rapcal}) is implemented for tracking each
local DOM clock's offset from universal time, allowing PMT pulses that were
independently recorded in many DOMs to be recombined into events by surface
computers.

\subsection{\label{sec:dom_components} Components}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:sphere}Glass Sphere and Harness}

The glass sphere housing has diameter \SI{13}{''} and thickness \SI{0.5}{''}.
Spheres are specified to protect the inside electronics and PMT against long-term applied pressure of 
\unit[250]bar (\unit[2.6]km water depth)
as well as temporary overpressure up to \unit[690]bar during the refreezing of melted ice in the drill hole.
The housings were produced by Benthos, Inc., based on a design for deep-sea environments but using glass
with very low potassium or other radioactive trace elements that would contribute to the dark noise
count rate (Section~\ref{sec:darknoise}).  
Optical transmission was measured in representative glass samples as 93\% at \unit[400]nm,
decreasing to 50\% at \unit[340]nm and 10\% at \unit[315]nm (normal incidence, excluding Fresnel reflection).

%N.B. not borosilicate, according to analysis shown at final CDR 2005 (Claire's slides), in contrast
%to the Benthos sphere datasheet which says borosilicate

All spheres were tested up to \unit[10,000]psi hydrostatic pressure by the manufacturer.
Each was delivered as two hemispheres that mate precisely at the equator
and were sealed during assembly (Sec.~\ref{sec:dom_prodtest}).  The DOM
is held by an aluminum waistband with rubber gaskets against 
the glass above and below the equator seam. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:domcable} shows how the DOM is attached to the main down-hole cable via a system
of steel rope and chain that carries the weight load around the DOM.
The main cable bends around the DOM, and the DOM axis stays vertically aligned with the string.

neighboring DOMs.

\label{fig:domcable}
\end{figure}
%============================================================

\subsubsection{\label{sec:penetrator}Cable Penetrator, Cable and Connector}

A penetrator assembly brings three wire pairs out through a \unit[16.3]mm hole in
the DOM glass.  They are routed inside a customized cable, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:domcable},
and terminate at a pressure-tight, waterproof connector that mates with a similar connector
that continues each pair into the main cable.  One wire pair carries power and a
bidirectional digital communications stream, connecting ultimately with computers in the
IceCube Laboratory building (Sec.~\ref{sec:cablesystems}).
The other wires lead to neighboring DOMs directly above and below,
carrying local coincidence digital pulses that signify time-correlated hits in nearby DOMs (Sec.~\ref{sec:mainboard}).

DOMs were produced in two versions, in which the communications wire pair was either electrically
terminated (\unit[150]$\Omega$) or unterminated inside the DOM.  The
terminated DOM is deployed \unit[17]m below the unterminated one (\unit[7]m
or \unit[10]m in DeepCore strings) and therefore includes a correspondingly 
long penetrator assembly cable (bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:domcable}).

The entire penetrator assembly was designed and produced by SEACON
(California).  The part that seals against the DOM glass is a
hollow steel bolt that is secured inside the DOM by a nut and spring
washer and compresses a fluorosilicone O-ring against the outside surface.
The steel part includes additional sealing around the wires that pass
through it.  Outside the DOM, a plastic shell is molded around the steel
and onto the cable jacket.  External mechanical features like the
penetrator are subject to large stresses during deployment and the
refreezing process; a right angle bend outside the DOM was included for
robustness, based on previous experience deploying AMANDA modules.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:pmt}PMT, Gel and Magnetic Shield}

DOMs use the \SI{10}{''}-diameter Hamamatsu R7081-02 PMT, 
or the corresponding high-quantum-efficiency (HQE) version for DeepCore strings.
Its properties have been measured and described in Ref.~\cite{ref:pmt}.
The PMT is specified by Hamamatsu for the wavelength range
\unit[300]nm--\unit[650]nm, with peak quantum efficiency around 25\% (34\%
for HQE) near \unit[390]nm.  It features a box-and-line dynode chain with 10 stages,
with in-ice DOMs operated at gain $10^7$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:domcal}).

The PMT bulb faces downwards in the bottom glass hemisphere, secured in high-strength 
silicone gel to a depth sufficient to surround the photocathode area.  
The gel provides both mechanical support for the whole assembly of PMT and circuit boards,
as well as good optical coupling.  
The gel thickness between PMT envelope and glass sphere is approximately \unit[1]cm.  
Originally the gel was supplied as General Electric RTV6136-D1,
and later as a similar formulation from Quantum Silicones (Virginia, USA).  
It is optically clear with transmission 97\% at \unit[400]nm, 91\% at \unit[340]nm, and 65\% at \unit[300]nm
(normal incidence).  The refractive index is 1.41, yielding less than 0.1\% Fresnel reflection as light
passes from the sphere glass into the gel and then into the PMT envelope.
The characteristics of the cured gel are specified to remain stable in the temperature range $-70^\circ$C to $45^\circ$C.

To reduce effects of the ambient South Pole magnetic field (\unit[550]mG, $17^\circ$
from vertical) on the PMT collection efficiency, a mu-metal cage surrounds the PMT bulb up to
the neck join.  It was constructed as a wire mesh with typical wire spacing \unit[66]mm and
wire diameter \unit[1]mm, blocking about 4\% of the incident light.
Without such a shield, this type of PMT would exhibit 5-10\% lower
collection efficiency, poorer peak-to-valley ratio, and gain variations of 20\% depending on 
azimuthal orientation~\cite{calvo}.
With the shield in place, the interior magnetic field is a factor 2.8 below
the external field, pointing mostly along the axis and therefore reducing efficiency by
less than 2\% for this type of PMT.

Other interior DOM components are held in place by attachment to the PMT, mostly via screws into
a molded plastic collar glued around the PMT neck.  The PMT Base Board is soldered directly to the pins.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:hv}High Voltage Supply and Divider}

The PMT high voltage subsystem consists of a resistive voltage divider
circuit (PMT Base Board) directly
solder-mounted on the PMT and a separate High Voltage Control Board. 
The High Voltage Control Board includes a DAC and ADC for setting and reading out the PMT high voltage,
connected to the Main Board with a digital interface.  It also holds the high voltage generator, which
is a custom encapsulated module designed by EMCO (California).  The maximum high voltage is
\unit[2047]volts, specified for up to \unit[30]$\mu A$ current.  The set voltage is proportional to the DAC
output, and the actual voltage is monitored via a high-impedance divider and the ADC.  The output ripple
is less than \unit[1]mV, and stability is better than \unit[200]ppm over
8~hours.  Power consumption is less than \unit[300]mW at full load.

The generator output is carried to the PMT Base Board \cite{ICECUBE:PMT} via a high voltage
coaxial cable.  The voltage divider presents a total resistive load of \unit[130]M$\Omega$.
The PMT is operated with cathode at ground potential, so the anode signal output is AC-coupled using 
a 1:1 bifilar-wound toroid transformer mounted on the Base Board; this
toroid was modified once during DOM production in order to reduce
distortion of high-amplitude signals (Sec.~\ref{sec:waveformcal}).
The transformer secondary is then wired to the Main Board analog input with a coaxial cable.
The single photoelectron (SPE) output waveform has been described in Ref.~\cite{ICECUBE:PMT}.  
With a \unit[100]$\Omega$ load connected to the transformer, and operating at standard gain $10^7$, the SPE 
peak voltage is approximately \unit[8]mV
with a FWHM of \unit[7--8]ns.  When measured on the Main Board, several effects combine to increase
the FWHM of digitized SPE waveforms to $\sim$\unit[13]ns (peak $\sim$\unit[5]mV).

\subsubsection{\label{sec:mainboard}Main Board and Delay Board}

The Main Board and its operation has been described in detail in \cite{ref:domdaq}.  
It interfaces to other boards as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:domcomponents} and
provides many key functions of the DOM, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Control of all the devices inside the DOM, including the high voltage power supply for the PMT, 
the flasher board, and various sensors (pressure, temperature, power supply voltage monitor). 
Also supplies necessary DC power to the subsystems.}
\item{Digitization of the PMT waveforms, using a custom ASIC (ATWD: Analog
  Transient Waveform Digitizer) and a continuously sampling fast ADC (fADC).}
\item{Providing computational functions, including PMT gain calibration, compressing 
digitized waveforms, temporarily storing the data, and creating time-stamped data packets.}
\item{Communicating with the data acquisition (DAQ) system on the surface.}
\item{Exchanging timing pulses with the surface DAQ to calibrate the internal DOM clock. }
\item{Exchanging local coincidence pulses with the adjacent DOMs.}
\end{enumerate}

The data flow starting from the PMT is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:domdataflow}.
PMT waveforms are amplified and compared to the discriminator threshold of \unit[0.25]SPE,
which is sufficient to begin a "launch" of the high speed waveform capture and digitization.
The ATWD chips are configured to sample the input voltage at \unit[300]Msps
and operate by analog storage of waveform samples in switched capacitor arrays of depth 128,
followed by a 10-bit digitization \cite{atwd}.  In order to record the waveform starting from before the discriminator
threshold crossing, the signal is first routed through the Delay Board.  Here a total delay of about
\unit[75]ns is accomplished by a \unit[$\sim10$]m-long, \unit[0.25]mm-wide
serpentine copper trace embedded in the dielectric and sandwiched between
ground planes.  ATWD chips are provided with three different preamplifier
gains in order to completely cover the 
dynamic range of the PMT output (up to 150mA when saturated).  The highest-gain channel is used
for most pulses, and lower-gain recordings are also retained as needed when pulses reach 75\% of the range 
of a higher gain channel.  The mean preamplifier gains of all deployed DOMs for high-,
medium-, and low-gain channels are 15.6, 1.79, and 0.21 respectively.


As explained in Ref.~\cite{ref:domdaq}, two sets of ATWD chips are operated alternately in order to
reduce deadtime.  The remaining deadtime depends upon the DOM trigger
rate, which varies seasonally based on the atmospheric muon flux. 
The median fractional deadtimes during a high-rate period for in-ice DOMs
is $6.6\times10^{-5}$, for IceTop low-gain DOMs is $7.2\times 10^{-6}$, and
for IceTop high-gain DOMs is $3.2 \times 10^{-3}$.  

The ATWD recording interval is \unit[427]ns.  This is ideal for reconstructing light produced within ~\unit[50]m of
a DOM, but photons from further away may arrive over a broader time
interval due to the optical scattering of the ice.  Such distant signals are
also lower in amplitude, and the information is captured in the \unit[40]Msps fADC.
The fADC samples continuously, and the FPGA is programmed to save an interval of \unit[6.4]$\mu$s after the launch. Its preamplifier provides a dynamic 
range comparable to the high-gain ATWD channel, but has extra pulse shaping to accommodate the lower
sampling speed.

Every digitizer launch results in a ``hit'' record being sent to the surface computers, but the amount of
information included depends on whether a signal was also detected in one of the neighboring DOMs.
In case of an isolated signal (no coincidence), only a time stamp and brief charge summary is sent, and
the full digitization process is aborted.  Conversely, when a nearest or next-to-nearest neighbor DOM 
also signals a launch within $\pm$\unit[1]$\mu$s (local coincidence), the full waveform is compressed
and included in the hit record.  The local coincidence signaling operates via digital pulse codes sent on
the extra wire pairs described in Sec.~\ref{sec:penetrator}.

 \caption{Data flow diagram for recording and processing of PMT waveforms in the DOM to form 
 "Hit Records" that are sent to the surface DAQ computers.  As shown by dashes, full waveform data is only included
 when neighbor DOMs report time-coincident signals above the SPE discriminator threshold.  Additionally,
 data from low gain channels is omitted for waveforms that are within range of higher gain channels.}
 \label{fig:domdataflow}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{\label{sec:flasher}Flasher Board}

Each DOM contains an LED Flasher Board, used for a
variety of calibration purposes, including: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verifying the timing response of the DOMs throughout the
  software.
\item Measuring the position of the deployed DOMs in ice.
\item Measuring the optical properties of the ice.
\item Verifying the performance of cascade reconstruction algorithms
  in measuring position, direction, and energy.
\end{enumerate}

The standard Flasher Board, included in every DOM except the color DOMs
described below, is an annular board fitted with 12 LEDs (ETG-5UV405-30)
specified with output wavelength \unit[$405\pm5$]nm.  Laboratory
measurements with sample DOMs indicate a peak at
\unit[399]nm and spectral width \unit[14]nm (FHWM), which includes a
\unit[$-1$]nm shift when operating at low temperature.
The LEDs are arranged in pairs, evenly spaced around the board
with a 60$^{\circ}$ separation between each pair. One LED in each pair
points outward horizontally, and the other LED is tilted upward at an angle
of 48$^{\circ}$, close to the Cherenkov angle in ice.
The angular emission profile of each LED has a FWHM of
30$^{\circ}$ in air and is modeled as a Gaussian emission profile
with $\sigma = 13^{\circ}$. After refraction through the DOM glass and into
the ice, the emission profile is modified to $\sigma = 9.7^{\circ}$ in the polar direction
and $9.8^{\circ}$ in the azimuthal direction for the tilted LEDs, and $\sigma=9.2^{\circ}$ in the polar direction
and $10.1^{\circ}$ in the azimuthal direction for the horizontal LEDs.
About 10\% of the light is emitted outside the Gaussian beam, modeled by
a secondary profile proportional to $(1+\cos{\alpha})$, where $\alpha$ is the angle
away from the LED axis.

The LEDs are controlled by a current pulse applied to each LED through
a high-speed MOSFET driver with a series resistor. The LEDs can be turned on individually or in any
combination of the 12, by setting bits in a configuration parameter.
The photon output of each LED depends on the width and
amplitude of the driving current pulse, which are controlled as common
values for all enabled LEDs in each DOM (Figure~\ref{fig:flasheroutput}).  
The pulse width parameter (0-127) controls width up to a maximum of \unit[70]{ns}; 
for sufficiently short driving current pulses the light output narrows to \unit[6]{ns} (FWHM) with
10\% afterglow decaying over \unit[15--20]{ns}.
The brightness parameter (0-127) controls the driving voltage between $4.5$ and \unit[15]{volts}, yielding
peak current up to \unit[300]{mA}.
By varying brightness and width settings as well as the number of LEDs enabled, DOMs can generate flashes
from $10^6$ to $1.4\times10^{11}$ photons, similar to the total light from
neutrino interaction cascades between \unit[7]GeV and \unit[1]PeV energy.
The low end of this dynamic range requires fine tuning of driving parameters because of
operating LEDs very close to threshold.

on brightness and width configuration parameters.  Additional dynamic range is available
by enabling from 1 to 12 individual LEDs per DOM.}
 \label{fig:flasheroutput}
\end{figure}

The LED current waveforms are recorded in an auxiliary ATWD channel, supplying
a rising edge time that also establishes the onset of the optical pulse (after a known
turn-on delay).
The repetition rate is programmable up to \unit[610]{Hz}.
Although flashers can be
operated in multiple DOMs in the same run, the DAQ does not support
time-synchronized flashing of LEDs on different DOMs, so coincident flasher
events happen only by chance. 

Sixteen ``color DOMs'' (cDOMs) are fitted with multi-wavelength
Flasher Boards; 8 are deployed on String~79 in the center of IceCube, and 8
are deployed on String~14 on the edge of IceCube.  Each cDOM includes 3 LEDs with a nominal
wavelength of 505~nm, 3 LEDs with a nominal wavelength of 450~nm, 3
LEDs with a nominal wavelength of 370~nm, and 3 LEDs with a nominal
wavelength of 340~nm. The LEDs are arranged in pairs as on the
standard flasher board, but all LEDs point outward horizontally. 
The properties of the LEDs are given in
Table~\ref{table:cdom_properties}.

\begin{table}

\subsection{\label{sec:dom_prodtest} Production and Testing}

Approximately 5500 in-ice and IceTop DOMs were required to be built, tested,
and delivered to the South Pole.  The DOMs were required to satisfy
stringent requirements needed for them to work reliably buried deep
in the ice for at least 20 years.  As hot-water drilling was the principal
driver of the deployment timeline, the DOM production schedule was
structured to supply DOMs as needed and to avoid any inventory shortfall.
The production was implemented in a 3-stage approach. Stage 1 was
the production and testing of the initial 400 DOMs at three sites: one in the United
States (Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL), Stoughton, Wisconsin) and two
in Europe (DESY, Zeuthen, Germany and Stockholm University, Sweden).  This
quantity of DOMs was sufficient to verify production readiness, supply
instrumentation for the first year drilling plan, and validate the design after a deployment
season.  During Stage 2, material and supplies were procured, and another
1000 DOMs produced. Finally, Stage 3 involved procurements,
integration, and testing of the remaining 4100 DOMs.

DOM production utilized a formalized process to track each DOM through to
the end of the testing process, with each step recorded in a DOM Process
Traveler.  Technicians were trained and certified to perform DOM
integration and test tasks, and each site had separate quality control
personnel. Commercial materials were confirmed to be fully tested by the
suppliers, and regular visits were made to key vendors.  Measurement
equipment was calibrated and records maintained that verified their
traceability to a reference standard.  DOM integration took place in an
ESD-, temperature-, and humidity-controlled environment.  The introduction
of these manufacturing protocols based on electronics industry best
practices allowed for each production site to work independently yet
produce DOMs that performed identically.

DOM integration started with the attachment of the PMT collar
to the PMT.  The collar provides a mounting point for the electronic boards inside
a DOM. The PMT was then mounted into a special jig that allowed for precise
placement inside the bottom glass hemisphere.  In parallel, the mu-metal
shield was placed inside the bottom hemisphere, and the
gel was mixed and poured into the same hemisphere. The gel was then
degassed in order to avoid bubbles and cracks (``crazing'') in the gel.
After degassing, the PMT was placed in the gel and allowed to cure for 48
hours.  After curing, the PMT Base Board was soldered onto the leads of the
PMT.  Separately, the PC Board Stack was assembled by attaching the Delay
Board, Main Board, Flasher Board, and High Voltage Control Board together.
The Board Stack was then mounted onto the PMT collar, the penetrator assembly
was mounted into the top hemisphere, and the two halves of the sphere were
joined.  The spheres were then evacuated and backfilled with dry nitrogen,
a butyl rubber sealant applied around the seam, and the seam covered with
wide plastic tape. The interior gas pressure was reduced to 0.5 bar (at
room temperature) so that the seal remains tight even at the minimum
ambient South Pole air pressure of 0.64 bar.

As the DOMs are not serviceable after deployment, an extensive testing
protocol (Final Acceptance Testing, or FAT) including temperature-cycling
and cold-soaking ensured that bad modules and early component failures were
identified and repaired before shipping.  This testing at production sites
was performed in Dark Freezer Labs (DFLs), light-tight walk-in 
modules capable of sustaining temperatures down to \SI{-55}{C}.  Main Board
and DOM functionality was tested by self-diagnostic software installed on
each module.  Other tests include gain calibration, dark noise monitoring,
and local coincidence validation.  Optical sensitivity, time resolution,
and linearity were measured using external light sources fed into the mDFLs
via optical fibers and diffused over the DOM lower hemispheres at each
testing station.  A typical FAT temperature and testing cycle is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:fat_cycle}. The initial pass rate of DOMs during FAT was
92\%.  The primary causes of failures were elevated noise rates during the
low-temperature soak, functional issues on the Main Board or Flasher Board,
and PMT gain instability.  The majority of failing DOMs were retested and
subsequently passed, while DOMs with serious issues were repaired and
retested prior to shipment. After the successful completion of FAT, DOM
deployment harnesses were attached and the DOMs individually packed. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

 \caption{Final Acceptance Testing (FAT) temperature profile, including
   testing steps performed at each stage.}
 \label{fig:fat_cycle}
\end{figure}

All DOMs were also re-tested at the South Pole before final deployment, to
screen out any modules damaged during transit.  The self-diagnostic
program and dark noise measurements were performed with the DOMs still in
their packing boxes, covered with additional light-tight material.  Of the
approximately 5500 DOMs shipped to South Pole, about 30 (0.5\%) were
returned to the U.S.~after failing on-ice testing.    

\subsection{\label{sec:reliability}Reliability}

As of 2016, 5397 of the 5484 deployed DOMs ($98.4\%$) are operating in
data-taking mode in the data acquisition system (see Table
\ref{tab:dom_failures}).  We classify DOM 
failures into two broad categories: failures during deployment and
freeze-in, and failures during subsequent operation.  The majority of the
failures (55) occurred before post-deployment commissioning; we hypothesize
that these are primarily attributable to cable failures, water leaks,
or freeze-in damage. 32 DOMs have failed after commissioning, and
we include in this count modules on a wire pair taken out of service when
the partner DOM on the same pair failed.  No particular pattern in the
failures is observed, other than they are typically during non-standard
operation or an exceptional event: a power outage, calibration run, or
flash filesystem upgrade.  The most recent two DOMs failed on May 23, 2013,
losing communications after a power outage.  Diagnosis of DOM failures
beyond identifying electrical shorts is challenging.

A number of DOMs have developed issues that affect their data-taking
configuration but are still usable.  For example, DOMs with a single functional
ATWD chip have a higher deadtime but are otherwise good.  The local
coincidence settings of DOMs of functional DOMs adjacent on a string to
dead DOMs must also be modified. These are enumerated in Table \ref{tab:dom_failures}.

    commissioning during detector operation, as well as DOMs with various

We can estimate the surviving fraction of DOMs 25 years after the original
deployment, assuming a constant, random failure rate after freeze-in.
Specifically, we calculate the Wilson score binomial confidence interval \cite{Wilson_Score} of
survival probability using the post-commissioning failure rate of DOMs.
The estimated survival fraction as a function of 
time is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dom_survival}; currently we estimate the
surviving fraction in 2030 to be $97.3\pm0.3\%$.  While this simplified
model does not account for an increase in failure rate due to component aging, the
observed failure rate since detector completion of $2.0~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ is
currently both stable and significantly lower than the mean predicted rate
of $4.5~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.  We attribute 
this to infant mortality and/or to improved operational protocols that
minimize the number of DOM power cycles.

 constant post-freeze-in failure rate.  The dotted lines indicate the
 central and 95\% CL estimates.  Increases before 2011 are due
 to deployments of new strings.}
